## Prerequisites & Dependencies

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   *Node.js:*  Download and install the latest LTS version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   *npm (Node Package Manager):*  Typically installed with Node.js.
*   *Git:* For cloning the repository.

The project relies on these key dependencies:

*   *React:* For building the user interface.
*   *React DOM:*  For rendering React components in the browser.
*   *React Router DOM:* For handling client-side routing.
*   *Tailwind CSS:* For styling the application.
*   *Axios:* For making HTTP requests.
*   *Js-cookie:*  For managing cookies (likely for authentication or session management).
*   *Socket.IO Client:* For real-time communication.
*   *Vite:*  As a build tool and development server.
*   *Eslint:* For code linting and formatting.

## Installation & Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project running:

1.  *Clone the repository:*

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mukesh1765/Chat-App.git
    cd Chat-App
    

2.  *Navigate to the client directory:*

    bash
    cd client
    

3.  *Install client-side dependencies:*

    bash
    npm install
    

4.  *Start the development server:*

    bash
    npm run dev
    

    This will typically start the development server on http://localhost:5173 or a similar address.  Check the console output for the exact URL.

5. *(Assuming there is a server-side component):*
   -If there is server side code, make sure to install the server side dependencies and run the server.
   -The server-side installation and execution instructions are not present in the original information. But commonly the server would be in the root directory of the project.

## Usage Examples

The application provides a chat interface. The exact functionality depends on server side logic which is not contained in the given files.
